          Hello! My name is Kaylynn Diaz and I enjoy developing new and
          interesting things for the internet. My interest in software
          development started with my first python class and then subsequently
          my first student development job.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to today and I have worked with Full Stack development
          team, frontend development, web security testing, managed work as a
          scrum master, and managed implementation of various projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main focus is to continually improve my skills and experience and
          be able to use my creativity to develop solutions for various
          scenarios.
